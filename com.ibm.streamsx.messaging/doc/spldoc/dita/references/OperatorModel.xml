<section id="overview">
<p>
An operator model can be used to describe a C++ primitive operator or a Java primitive operator. The set of elements that can 
be present in a Java operator model is a strict subset of the ones that can be present in a C++ operator model, with the 
exception of a special element used for JVM related configurations.
</p>
</section>
<section id="context">
<title outputclass="splhead-1">Context</title>
<p>
The context element describes the properties that apply to the operator as a whole and are not associated
with particular parameters or ports of the operator. It also includes common definitions that are referenced in 
other places in the operator model.

  <dlentry id="context__providessinglethreadedexecutioncontext">
    <dt>Provides Single Threaded Execution Context (C++ only)</dt>
    <dd><p>The <tt>providesSingleThreadedContext</tt> element describes the threading semantics of the
operator with respect to the flow of execution. An operator provides a single threaded execution context, 
if and only if: 
      <ul>
        <li>It does not perform concurrent submit calls unless its process method(s) are called concurrently.</li>
        <li>Its submit calls complete before the process call that triggered the submission completes.</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>Both source and non-source operators have process methods, and the definition above applies
globally. Based on this definition, if an operator has submit calls that are not triggered by a process
call, such as those triggered by a time-based event, then that operator does not provide a single threaded
execution context. Note that this definition does not require a submit call to execute under the same 
thread that executes the process call which triggered the submission (even though in the common case 
they execute under the same thread).
    </p>
    <p>There are several valid values for this property:
<ul>
  <li><tt>Never:</tt> Instances of this operator never provide a single threaded execution context.</li>
  <li><tt>Always:</tt> Instances of this operator always provide a single threaded execution context.</li>
  <li><tt>WindowBound:</tt> Instances of this operator that do not specify time-based window eviction
policies or time-based window trigger policies provide a single threaded execution context.</li>
  <li><tt>WindowEvictionBound:</tt> Instances of this operator that do not specify time-based window 
eviction policies provide a single threaded execution context.</li>
  <li><tt>WindowTriggerBound:</tt> Instances of this operator that do not specify time-based window trigger
policies provide a single threaded execution context.</li>
  <li><tt>WindowPartitionEvictionBound:</tt> Instances of this operator use a thread to implement 
partition eviction. Use this setting if tuples are submitted from the onWindowPartitionEvictionSelection event.</li>
</ul>
    </p>
<p>
As an example, consider a <tt>Filter</tt> operator. Unless its process method is being called concurrently,
the <tt>Filter</tt> operator does not make concurrent submit calls. Its submit calls are triggered by incoming
tuples. When it receives a tuple via a process call, it makes a submit call if the received tuple passes the
filter condition, and that submit call completes before the process call that triggered it is complete. As a
result, all instances of a <tt>Filter</tt> operator provide a single threaded context and the setting
<tt>Always</tt> is appropriate.
</p>
<p>
Implementation note: The <tt>providesSingleThreadedContext</tt> element is used to enable the SPL runtime 
to avoid unnecessary thread synchronization. While setting it to the value Never is safe for all operators, 
it would prevent optimizations that reduce synchronization overhead when the operator does provide a single 
threaded context. Specifying a value other than Never that is inconsistent with the threading semantics 
implemented by the operator will result in undefined behavior.
</p>

         for that operator. This is the default mode.</li>
         <li><tt>ResultDependent:</tt> In this mode the compiler always generates the operator source, but 
         only updates the source files if they differ from what exists prior to the compile. Use this 
         mode if the operator code generator relies on external configurations that are not captured by the parameterization given in the SPL source.

    <dd><p>This optional element specifies whether or not the use of an operator is permitted to 
have a logic clause specifying either state, <tt>onTuple</tt> or <tt>onPunct</tt> processing. When set to false no 
logic clause may be specified for the given operator. The default, in the absence of this element,

   </dlentry>
   <dlentry id="context__codetemplate">
    <dt>Code Template (C++ only)</dt>
    <dd><p>This optional element specifies one or more code templates for the operator. 
These will show up in IDE's context sensitive content assist menus and SPLDOC documents. 
Each code template has a name attribute that names it, a description element that describes it, 
and a value element, which is a string that contains the boilerplate code for the template. 
When the template is used in the IDE, the boilerplate code is embedded into the source code. 
The parts of the code that are in the form ${name} are used to indicate the pieces that must be 
customized by the user. The IDE will use the identifier specified within the ${} to indicate the customizable 
portions. One example for the Barrier operator is as follows:
</p>
<p>
<codeblock>
&lt;codeTemplates>
  &lt;codeTemplate name="Barrier">
    &lt;description>Basic Barrier template&lt;/description>

function type, as in RelationalAggs; and the default element, which defines the default output function to be used when
performing auto-assignment of output attributes. This value should be a valid function name for the custom output function
type that is being used (as in Last for RelationalAggs). Note that if the user code specifies an output attribute assignment
without an output function for a port that expects an output function,
the default output function will be inserted automatically.

    <dlentry id="output_port_set__finalpunctuationoutputscope">
    <dt>Final Punctuation Port Scope</dt>
    <dd>
The <tt>finalPunctuationPortScope</tt> element, which is optional, specifies the set of input ports to be used by the SPL language
runtime for final punctuation forwarding. By default, operators that have both input and output ports will automatically
forward final punctuations from their input ports to their output ports. This is achieved by generating a final punctuation
on an output port when a final punctuation is received on all input ports. The finalPunctuationPortScope can be used to
limit the set of input ports to be used for forwarding the final punctuation. This element can also be used to turn off
auto-forwarding of final punctuations, by setting the set of input ports to use for forwarding to the empty set. In this case, 
the operator developer is responsible for ensuring that the output port gets a final punctuation.

  <dlentry id="output_port_set__windowpunctuationoutputmode">
    <dt>Window Punctuation Output Mode</dt>
    <dd>
The windowPunctuationOutputMode specifies the window punctuation semantics of the output port. The options are:
<ul>
<li><tt>Generating</tt> - This port generates window punctuations.</li>
<li><tt>Free</tt> - This port is free of window punctuations.</li>
<li><tt>Preserving</tt> - This port preserves the received window punctuations. If an operator has more than one
input port, then the windowPunctuationInputPort element must be specified in order to identify which input port's
punctuation is being preserved.</li>
</ul>
    </dd>
  </dlentry>
  <dlentry id="output_port_set__tuplemutationallowed">
    <dt>Tuple Mutation Allowed</dt>
    <dd>
The <tt>tupleMutationAllowed</tt> element defines whether this operator permits the downstream operators to mutate the output
tuples submitted to this port via the submit call. If set to true, then the processing logic of the operator should expect
that the tuples it submits to this port are modified as a result of the submit call.
    </dd>
  </dlentry>
  <dlentry id="output_port_set__windowpunctuationinputport">
    <dt>Window Punctuation Input Port</dt>
    <dd>
As mentioned above, the <tt>windowPunctuationInputPort</tt> element associates an input port with a punctuation 
preserving output port. This element may only be specified if the output port's window punctuation mode is Preserving. 
The windowPunctuationInputPort can be set to -1, which has the same semantics as a missing windowPunctuationInputPort element. 
It is important to note that punctuation forwarding for window punctuations is not performed automatically by the SPL 
language runtime (unlike final punctuations) and the operator model is used to inform the SPL compiler about the behavior 
that is being implemented by the operator. For more information, see IBM Streams Processing Language Toolkit Development Reference.

 If a scope is specified, only attributes from the ports specified by the scope

         <dd>This boolean parameter allows the compiler to rewrite the expressions that appear in this parameter's 
values by substituting literals (including those resulting from compile-time evaluation step) with variables whose
values are loaded at runtime. This enables the compiler to generate less code for operators that differ slightly
in their parameter configurations. In certain cases, the operator code generators may want to look into the parameter
value, in order to generate different code based on the particular value found or perform compile-time validation. 
For example, <tt>format: csv</tt> may result in generating specialized code for a Source operator. In such cases, expression
rewrite should be turned off.</dd>
