##README --  IBMStreams/streamsx.messaging

The IBMStreams/streamsx.messaging toolkit project is an open source Streams toolkit project focused on the development of operators and functions that extend IBM InfoSphere Streams ability to interact with messaging systems.




 To get started with building the toolkit:
 
 1)  Download and install Maven on your system
 
 2)  At the command line, go to the root of the messaging toolkit
 
 3)  Type "ant"
 
 
 This would invoke the Ant script, which in turn, will invoke Maven.  Maven is used to download all dependencies needed for the toolkit.  After dependencies are downloadd, the Ant script will proceed to build the java files required to buidl the toolkit.
