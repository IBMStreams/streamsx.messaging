## README --  IBMStreams/streamsx.messaging

The IBMStreams/streamsx.messaging toolkit project is an open source Streams toolkit project focused on the development of operators and functions that extend IBM InfoSphere Streams ability to interact with messaging systems.

Messaging Toolkit v5.1 is offically released to support InfoSphere Streams v4.2:
* https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.messaging/releases

This toolkit contains support for: 

* JMS
* XMS

**Deprecations**

The support for RabbitMQ, Kafka, and MQTT in this toolkit is deprecated. For these types of messaging systems, use one of the following specialized open source toolkits:

* [streamsx.kafka](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.kafka)
* [streamsx.rabbitmq](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.rabbitmq)
* [streamsx.mqtt](https://github.com/IBMStreams/streamsx.mqtt)
